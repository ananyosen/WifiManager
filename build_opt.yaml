# vala ui files, composite templates, in deps order(optionally)
# generator will try to find the corresponding vala file and compile it
# if not found a warning will be shown
# example. if an ui file is added as hello.ui, it will try to find and add helloui.vala to vala_files

# - custom.ui

#     vala_path: "/this/can/be/relative/or/absolute/whatever.vala"
# using 'null' as vala path will ensure the generator will not add anything to vala compile list
